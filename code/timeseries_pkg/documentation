Overview:
The timeseries module is a tool for time series analysis. Using this module, you can import a time series from a file, break it into contiguous sections, and do some basic autoregressive modeling.

Classes:
Series:
An object of the Series class is a time series. Series holds the data, timestamps, and headers, and provides the methods to do data processing.

Wrapper:
This class wraps several Series objects into one. Generally, the wrapper will hold all the data from a single file. Its methods will split the series into continuous sub-series and smooth over small gaps within those sub-series.

Model:
A regression model using least squares to estimate the model parameters.
