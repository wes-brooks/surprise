  abstract = {The concept of surprise is central to sensory processing, adaptation,
	learning, and attention. Yet, no widely-accepted mathematical theory
	currently exists to quantitatively characterize surprise elicited
	by a stimulus or event, for observers that range from single neurons
	to complex natural or engineered systems. We describe a formal Bayesian
	definition of surprise that is the only consistent formulation under
	minimal axiomatic assumptions. Surprise quantifies how data affects
	a natural or artificial observer, by measuring the difference between
	posterior and prior beliefs of the observer. Using this framework
	we measure the extent to which humans direct their gaze towards surprising
	items while watching television and video games. We find that subjects
	are strongly attracted towards surprising locations, with 72 percent
	of all human gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising
	than the average, a figure which rises to 84 percent when considering
	only gaze targets simultaneously selected by all subjects. The resulting
	theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal
	scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

  abstract = {Primates demonstrate unparalleled ability at rapidly orienting towards
	important events in complex dynamic environments. During rapid guidance
	of attention and gaze towards potential objects of interest or potential
	threats, however, often there is no time for detailed visual analysis.
	Thus, heuristic computations are necessary to locate the most interesting
	events in quasi real-time. We present a new theory of sensory surprise,
	which provides a principled and computable shortcut to important
	information. We develop a model that computes instantaneous low-level
	surprise at every location in video streams. The algorithm significantly
	correlates with eye movements of two human observers watching complex
	video clips, including television programs (17,936 frames, 2,152
	saccadic gaze shifts). The resulting system allows more sophisticated
	and time-consuming image analysis to be efficiently focused onto
	the most surprising subsets of the incoming data.},
